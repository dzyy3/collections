# COMIX 

Welcome to a blogpost with some of the comics I've created at TNS! I hope to upload the rest in the future :o Since this is a fun website where I can upload illustrations that don't belong in my portfolio, not everything is finished or polished!

Check out some of the rough comic strips I've already made below :D
